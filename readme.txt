This visually illustrates three convex hull algorithms: Graham Scan, Quickhull, and Monotone chain. Currently there is a bug with quickhull that occurs roughly 5% of the time. 
Controls: Press 1, 2, and 3 to switch between algorithms. Press R to generate a new set of points. Press ‘-’ and ‘=’ to speed up or slow down the demo.  The program also can take in an argument via command line specifying the total number of points.
