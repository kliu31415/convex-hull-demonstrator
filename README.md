# convex-hull-demonstrator
This visually illustrates three convex hull algorithms: Graham Scan, Quickhull, and Monotone chain.  
Currently there is a bug with quickhull that occurs roughly 5% of the time.   
Controls:  
Press 1, 2, and 3 to switch between algorithms.  
Press R to generate a new set of points.  
Press ‘-’ and ‘=’ to speed up or slow down the demo.  
The program also can take in an argument via command line specifying the total number of points. (for example, to create 900 points: ./a.out -n 900)
